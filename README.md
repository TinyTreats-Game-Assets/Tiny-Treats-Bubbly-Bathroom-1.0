This is a small set of cute stylised low-poly game assets to make a cozy little bathroom with. It includes walls/floors/doors, a bathtub, several other decorations, and even a rubber ducky! These would be great to make a lifesim, or to just add a comfy little resting spot in your game.

### Features

- **24+ Stylised low-poly 3D models,** perfect for games across all platforms, including mobile.
- **Textured** using a single gradient atlas texture (1024x1024) that can be downsampled up to 128x128 for further optimization.
- Models are included as **.OBJ, .FBX** and **.GLTF,** That means the files work in most 3D game engines (including **Unity, Godot, Unreal Engine, Roblox,** and more)
- **Free for personal and commercial use,** no attribution required. (CC0 Licensed)
